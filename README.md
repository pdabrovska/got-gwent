# Game of Thrones Gwent

The inspiration for this project were two brands - 'The Witcher' and 'Game of Thrones'. Game of Thrones Gwent is not a commercial project.

Gwent is a game where two armies lock in a mortal struggle on the field of battle over a crown of seven kingdoms.

## About The Project
The main goal of this project was to build an app with vanilla JavaScript. Although there were some challenges, the overall process taught me a lot.

## Technologies
I used: html, css, Javascript, Visual Studio Code, Figma.
## Approach
Firstly the design was inspired by the original Gwent Game. I managed to make it responsive on different devices. I used flexbox and grid layout to achieve that.

Second, game mechanics. This is a player versus computer game. To make it more unpredictable and lively, I added special abilities to some cards: 'group', 'spy'ans 'bond'. 


The opponent (computer) is not fully intelligent yet. For now, it only has knowledge of when to pass the game. In a newer version, I plan to add the Minimax function.

## Status
Game of Thrones Gwent is still in progress. The new version with new features will be out soon.
